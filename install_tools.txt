# Docker images are very helpful to keep analysis reproducible.
# Using Nakato Lab docker images one can simply run several analysis.
# Most common tools are already pre installed and can be run without any problem.
# A caveat however is when a user need to have a specific tools installed.
# If the tool is very important for many other uses a request can be made to RNakato.
# If the tool is a testing approach, than I recommend doing the following process.

# Create a directory to host the packages in your user directory
mkdir -p image_dir

# Then run the image pointing to the above created directory
singularity exec -H /home/nagai/image_dir  --bind /work,/work2,/work3 /work/SingularityImages/shortcake.1.1.1.sif R

# A R prompt will open. Then you can simply install any tool using the normal procedures.
install.packages("dittoseq")
